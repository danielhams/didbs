test-select failure during make check (in gnulib-tests):

FAIL: test-select
=================

Invalid nfd test... failed (invalid errno after negative nfds)
Invalid fd test... failed (invalid fd among rfds)
  failed (invalid fd among wfds)
  failed (invalid fd among xfds)
Unconnected socket test... passed
Connected sockets test... passed
General socket test with fork... passed
Pipe test... passed
FAIL test-select (exit status: 4)

Could maybe be issue with select fd sets not failing as expected.
