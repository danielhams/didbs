misc/seq isn't correctly handling NAN parameters (the macros in seq.c don't correctly identify inf or nan) - FIXED by including math.h
misc/seq-precision fails, too.

One patch is to numfmt.c to add this near the top:

#if defined(__sgi)
# include <sys/fpu.h>
#endif

and then a bit further down this

#if HAVE_FPSETPREC && defined(fpsetprec)
  /* Enabled extended precision if needed.  */
  fpsetprec (FP_PE);
#elif defined(__sgi)
  union fpc_csr f;
  f.fc_word = get_fpc_csr();
  f.fc_struct.flush = 0;
  set_fpc_csr(f.fc_word);
#endif

Which fixes the precision issues (but not the strtod signing issue)

misc/shred-remove fail
misc/sleep fail
misc/sort-float fail
misc/sort-month fail
misc/sync fail
misc/yes fail
dd/sparse ERROR (setup)
ln/sf-1 fail

Then we get up to ### and that's as far as it gets, it fails with argument list too long (all parameters together are just too much for it.)
