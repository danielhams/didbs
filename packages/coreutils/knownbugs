misc/seq isn't correctly handling NAN parameters (the macros in seq.c don't correctly identify inf or nan) - FIXED by including math.h
misc/seq-precision fails, too.
misc/shred-remove fail
misc/sleep fail
misc/sort-float fail
misc/sort-month fail
misc/sync fail
misc/yes fail
dd/sparse ERROR (setup)
ln/sf-1 fail

Then we get up to ### and that's as far as it gets, it fails with argument list too long (all parameters together are just too much for it.)
