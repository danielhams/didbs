misc/seq isn't correctly handling NAN parameters (the macros in seq.c don't correctly identify inf or nan) - FIXED by including math.h
misc/seq-precision fails, too.

One patch is to numfmt.c to add this near the top:

#if defined(__sgi)
# include <sys/fpu.h>
#endif

and then a bit further down this

#if HAVE_FPSETPREC && defined(fpsetprec)
  /* Enabled extended precision if needed.  */
  fpsetprec (FP_PE);
#elif defined(__sgi)
  union fpc_csr f;
  f.fc_word = get_fpc_csr();
  f.fc_struct.flush = 0;
  set_fpc_csr(f.fc_word);
#endif

Which fixes the precision issues (but not the strtod signing issue)

misc/shred-remove fail : This one looks like it might be down to a difference between the glibc renameat2 and the stub implementation in the coreutils project. Basically there seems to be some extra renames happening compared to what happens under linux (for example). Detail:

misc/sleep fail: Seems to be because !(0<=s) where s=nan thinks nan is positive.....

I've currently fixed by adding an "isnan" test for __sgi - but it can perhaps be better fixed by tweaking some floating point parameters (this should be ieee spec stuff, right?)

misc/sort-float fail - bah....
misc/sort-month fail - failure in sort when run under LC_ALL=fr_FR and 'sort -k2,2M'
misc/sync fail - "bad file number" for doing regular fsync(fd) - changing the open_flags to include write (like aix) fixes this one.
misc/yes fail
dd/sparse ERROR (setup) - this one seems to have been fixed by the fix to "sync"
dd/stats fail - (maybe just takes huge amount of time, I killed it after 15 mins)
ln/sf-1 fail - some of the name to long tests are failing - not clear why for the moment.
