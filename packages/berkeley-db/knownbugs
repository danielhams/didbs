Failures during test running.

Occasionally the "cutest" that launches all the test scenarios fails during the "TestDbTuner" - but it seems rare and a dbx of the resulting core shows little info other than SEGV from some memcpy.

The stack trace is mostly empty but when I reproduce it again I'll add it here.

Error when running build_unix/cutest:

...
Running suite TestDbTuner
Test db_tuner on various different kinds of btree, so it takes some time.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)


dbx of the coredump:

[dan@leafy build_unix]$ libtool --mode=execute dbx ./cutest ./core 
dbx version 7.3.4 (86441_Nov11 MR) Nov 11 2002 11:31:55

Which isn't a whole lot to go on.....
